    <p>
      The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the
      Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of
      stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story,
      the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati
      Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built
      only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an
      official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining
      building had to be made of brick and not stone.
